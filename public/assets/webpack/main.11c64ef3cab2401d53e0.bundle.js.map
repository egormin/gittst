class='gl-show-field-errors'>\n *  <input type='text' name='username' title='Username is required.'/>\n * </form>\n *\n * Ignore specific inputs (e.g. UsernameValidator):\n *\n * <form

<input type='text' name='username' title='Username is required.'/>\n *    </div>\n * </form>\n *\n * Custom Error Anchor (allows error message to be injected after specified element):\n *\n * <form
